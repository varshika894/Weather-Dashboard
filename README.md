# Weather-Dashboard
DESCRIPTION:
Search for a city to view its current and future weather conditions, and have that city added to your search history. Access the current weather details, including the city name, date,
a weather condition icon, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and UV index. The UV index is color-coded to indicate whether conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe. View the future 
weather forecast for the city, with a 5-day outlook that includes the date, a weather icon, temperature, and humidity. Clicking on a city in the search history will 
display both current and future conditions for that location again. When you open the weather dashboard, the forecast for the last searched city will be presented.
